    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>PandeCoco is one of the most popular bread in the Philippines. This bread is exactly the same as pandesal but it is stuffed with sweetened coconut grate inside.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups of flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 ounce yeast </li>
        <li>1 1/ cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour and sugar. </li>
        <li>Add the instant dry yeast and mix. </li>
        <li>Add the lukewarm milk, vegetable oil, and salt. Using a wooden spoon or spatula, mix until it sticks together and forms a dough.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough on a flat surface and knead for 5 minutes. Avoid adding more flour or the bread will be too dense and crumbly. If it is too sticky, apply some oil on your hands to prevent the dough from sticking.  If it is too dry, add a bit of oil to the dough. As you continue kneading, the dough should be less and less tacky and easier to handle.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Leave it to rise for 30 minutes to an hour or until it has almost doubled its size.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. In a pan, combine desiccated coconut, brown sugar, coconut milk, water, butter, and vanilla extract. Over low heat, bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook until liquid is mostly absorbed. If you prefer filling to be more compact and sticky (not crumbly), add 1 tablespoon flour dissolved in 1/4 cup of milk after the liquid has been absorbed. Continue to cook, stirring regularly, for another 2-3 minutes or until thick and sticky. </li>
        <li>Remove filling from heat and allow to slightly cool. </li>
        <li>Gently deflate the dough and tip it to a flat surface. Roll into a log and cut into half. Roll each half again and cut into two. Divide each log into 6 equal parts for a total of 24 pieces.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough pieces with a kitchen towel and let rest for at least 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flatten each dough with the palm of the hand. Hold the flattened dough in the curve of your hand and add about 1 tablespoon of coconut filling in the center. Pinch the corners together to fully enclose the filling.  </li>
        <li>Arrange the filled dough, pinched side down, on a baking sheet at about 1 inch apart.</li>
        <li>Using a fork, poke small holes in the center of each filled dough. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let them rest for another 20-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bake in a 340 F oven for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and brush with egg wash. Return to oven and bake for another 5 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>

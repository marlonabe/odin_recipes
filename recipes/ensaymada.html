    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 tbs yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 tbs salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, mix together milk, shortening, sugar and salt.</li>
        <li>Add half of the flour and the bloomed yeast and mix for 3-5 minutes at medium speed until a paste-like consistency is achieved.</li>
        <li>Add the egg yolks and the rest of flour and mix for another 3 minutes. Add more flour if the mixture is too liquid or too sticky but not too much.The dough is supposed to be sticky.</li>
        <li>Scrape the sides while folding the dough in the middle of the bowl and then cover with kitchen towel. Let it rest and rise in a warm place for 2-3 hours or until it doubled its size.</li>
        <li>Scrape the sides of the bowl while tipping the sticky dough over to the thinly floured working surface.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a log and cut into 2. Roll each log again and cut into 2. Repeat this process until you end up with 16 slices.</li>
        <li>Using a rolling pin, roll a slice into a rectangle (about 8x4 inch) and brush the surface with softened butter. Roll it from one end of the long side to the other end, creating a long, thin log then shape it into a coil (spiral) with the end tucked under.</li>
        <li>Place each coiled dough in a greased mold and let it rest in a warm place for about 30 minutes to 1 hour until it has risen to almost double its size.</li>
        <li>Bake them in a preheated oven at 300°F /150°C for 20-25 minutes. Once baked let them cool down for a few minutes before removing from molds.Then let them cool completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the buttercream by creaming ½ cup of softened butter and ½ cup powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Using a knife or spoon, cover the top of the ensaymadas with buttercream and lastly with a generous amount of grated cheese.</li>
    </ol>

        <li>In a big bowl, mix together flour, sugar, salt. </li>
        <li>Pour in milk, beaten egg and melted butter. Mix several times until well blended. Make sure that the milk is only mildly warm and not hot. </li>
        <li>Add the instant dry yeast and fold until a sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Tip the dough on a floured surface and knead until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball and lightly coat with oil. Place it in a bowl and cover with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm area and let it rise until it doubled in size. Depending how warm it is, could take 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide into 2 equal parts using a knife or dough slicer. Roll each into a log. Cut each log into 6 smaller pieces. </li>
        <li>Shape each piece into a ball and roll it in breadcrumbs, completely covering all sides.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pieces on a baking sheet living some gaps in between (at least an inch). Leave them to rise second time until double in size.</li>
